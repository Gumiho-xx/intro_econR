# intro_econR

This is the public repository for the first year master course **Introductory Econometrics with R** in JXUFE (http://www.jxufe.edu.cn/) for the 2nd semester of year 2020. 

The textbook for the course is *Introduction to Econometrics with R* by Christoph Hanck, Martin Arnold, Alexander Gerber and Martin Schmelzer. It is an Open Review book and the online version is available at https://www.econometrics-with-r.org. The book is just terrific and is the best so far for teaching introductory econometrics in my view. 

Slides are created by the awesome *xaringan* package by Yihui Xie (https://github.com/yihui/xaringan). The main content of the slides are based on the online textbook. The language of the slides is primarily Chinese.
